### **Introduction**

I'm M_etrics, a self-taught developer. I've been coding for over 5 years. I'm mainly a JavaScript and LUAU programmer on multiple platforms, including ROBLOX. Although, I have previously obtained knowledge within languages such as HTML. 

### **Projects**
I am currently working on projects in my studio, Stoneford Studios as the Lead Programmer. I've worked on the City of Raddleton (90K), South Pacific Airways (68K) and several other semi-known games. I'm somewhat a contributor to the Roblox Developer Forum, where I can support a range of developers in overcoming their coding errors/bugs. 

### **Technical Skills**
I have been using LUAU for over 5 years, this is my most proficient and I refer to myself as an Expert programming language that I have used. I've used frameworks such as Knit. I've been studying and use Javascript and have previously experimented with frameworks such as React and Vue. Javascript is a semi-strong language of mine that I have used for over 3 years and I refer myself to be a Proficient user of it - not an expert. I've also used HTML and Python actively over the past few years - not a professional by any means.

## Technical Skills

> - LUAU: I've been working with LUAU for over 5 years and consider myself an expert in the language. I'm proficient in utilizing various frameworks like Knit to build robust and efficient game systems.
> - JavaScript: With over 3 years of experience in JavaScript, I've developed a strong proficiency in the language. While I have primarily focused on discord bots and API, I've also explored frameworks like React and Vue 
    to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
> - HTML: I've actively used HTML in conjunction with JavaScript and CSS to develop responsive and visually appealing web pages. It's a fundamental language that I'm semi-comfortable working with.
> - Python: Although I'm not a professional Python developer. I continue to expand my knowledge in this versatile language.
